This is a classic arcade game similar to frogger.

# Installation

# Game instructions
To play the game, simply run ```index.html```. Once the game loads, the timer will start automatically. Here are the basic rules:

* Use the up, right, down, and left keys on your keyboard to move the player.
* The goal is to reach the water 5 times (each time you touch the water you get a point) within the 15 second time period.

See how quickly you can get to 5 points!
